# Module 1: EAFP vs LBYL - Complete Learning Path

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- The fundamental difference between EAFP and LBYL programming philosophies
- When to choose each approach based on performance and readability
- How to implement both patterns effectively in Python
- How to test code that uses different error handling strategies

---

## üìö Step 1: Understanding the Concepts

### EAFP vs LBYL Fundamentals

Two fundamental philosophies in Python for handling potential errors:

- **EAFP**: Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission
- **LBYL**: Look Before You Leap

### EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission)

**Philosophy**: Try the operation first, handle exceptions if they occur.

```python
# EAFP approach
try:
    value = my_dict['key']
except KeyError:
    value = default_value
```

**When to use EAFP**:
- When the "happy path" is most common
- When checking conditions is expensive
- When race conditions might occur between check and use
- When you want cleaner, more readable code for the success case

**Advantages**:
- More Pythonic (encouraged by Python culture)
- Better performance when exceptions are rare
- Cleaner code for the success path
- Avoids race conditions in multithreaded environments

### LBYL (Look Before You Leap)

**Philosophy**: Check conditions before performing operations.

```python
# LBYL approach
if 'key' in my_dict:
    value = my_dict['key']
else:
    value = default_value
```

**When to use LBYL**:
- When exceptions are expensive
- When you need to perform multiple related checks
- When the check is simple and fast
- When working with external resources where failures are common

**Advantages**:
- Explicit error checking
- Better performance when errors are common
- Clearer intent when multiple conditions need checking
- Familiar to developers from other languages

### Performance Considerations

- **EAFP** is generally faster in Python when exceptions are rare
- **LBYL** can be faster when exceptions are common (>10% of cases)
- Exception handling has overhead, but attribute lookup/checking also has costs
- Measure performance in your specific use case

### Real-World Examples

**File Operations**:
```python
# EAFP
try:
    with open('config.txt') as f:
        config = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    config = get_default_config()

# LBYL
import os
if os.path.exists('config.txt'):
    with open('config.txt') as f:
        config = f.read()
else:
    config = get_default_config()
```

**Dictionary Access**:
```python
# EAFP
try:
    return data['result']['value']
except KeyError:
    return None

# LBYL
if 'result' in data and 'value' in data['result']:
    return data['result']['value']
return None
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Hands-On Practice

### üìù **ACTION ITEM**: Study the Starter Example

**File to review**: `starter_example.py`

This file contains a `DictionaryHelper` class that demonstrates both approaches:
- `get_value_eafp()` - Uses try/except for dictionary access
- `get_value_lbyl()` - Uses `in` operator to check before access
- `convert_to_int_eafp()` - Uses try/except for type conversion
- `convert_to_int_lbyl()` - Uses type checking before conversion

**What to do**:
1. Open `starter_example.py` and read through the implementation
2. Notice how each method handles the same problem differently
3. Pay attention to the comments explaining the design decisions
4. Run the example to see both approaches in action

### üß™ **ACTION ITEM**: Run the Tests

**File to run**: `test_starter_example.py`

```bash
# Navigate to module 1 directory
cd module_1_eafp_vs_lbyl

# Run the tests to see both approaches working
python -m pytest test_starter_example.py -v
```

**What to observe**:
- Both EAFP and LBYL methods produce the same results
- The test cases cover success scenarios, error scenarios, and edge cases
- Notice how the tests verify that both approaches handle errors gracefully

## üìã Step 3: Complete the Assignments

### Assignment A: Write Tests (Test-Driven Learning)

**Objective**: Improve your understanding by writing comprehensive tests

**Files involved**:
- Read the requirements in the assignment details below
- Implement your tests in `test_assignment_a.py`

**Assignment A Details**:

You are given a `DataProcessor` class that needs better test coverage:

```python
class DataProcessor:
    def process_data_eafp(self, data_list):
        try:
            return [int(x) for x in data_list]
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            return []
    
    def process_data_lbyl(self, data_list):
        if not isinstance(data_list, list):
            return []
        result = []
        for item in data_list:
            if isinstance(item, (int, str)) and str(item).isdigit():
                result.append(int(item))
        return result
```

**Your task**: Write tests in `test_assignment_a.py` to achieve 100% coverage.

**Test scenarios to cover**:
- Valid numeric strings: `["1", "2", "3"]`
- Mixed valid/invalid data: `["1", "abc", "3"]`
- Non-list input: `"not a list"`
- Empty list: `[]`
- Integer inputs: `[1, 2, 3]`
- None input: `None`

### Assignment B: Implement Code (Code-Driven Learning)

**Objective**: Practice implementing both EAFP and LBYL patterns

**Files involved**:
- Implement your code in `assignment_b.py`
- Tests are provided in `test_assignment_b.py`

**Assignment B Details**:

Implement a `SafeCalculator` class with these methods:

1. `divide_eafp(a, b)` - Division using EAFP approach
   - Try the division, catch `ZeroDivisionError`
   - Return `None` for division by zero
   - Return the result for valid divisions

2. `divide_lbyl(a, b)` - Division using LBYL approach  
   - Check if `b` is zero before dividing
   - Return `None` for division by zero
   - Return the result for valid divisions

3. `safe_sqrt_eafp(x)` - Square root using EAFP approach
   - Try `math.sqrt()`, catch `ValueError` for negative numbers
   - Return `None` for negative inputs
   - Return the square root for valid inputs

**Run the tests**:
```bash
python -m pytest test_assignment_b.py -v
```

**Implementation tips**:
- Import `math` for square root operations
- Both methods should produce identical results
- Focus on demonstrating the different error handling philosophies
- Add comments explaining why you chose each approach


## Evaluation Criteria

- Correct implementation of EAFP vs LBYL patterns
- Proper error handling
- Code clarity and documentation
- Test coverage (Part A)
- All tests passing (Part B)

## üîç Step 4: Explore Advanced Concepts

### üìù **ACTION ITEM**: Try the Extra Exercises

**File to explore**: `extra_exercises.md`

This file contains additional challenges to deepen your understanding:
- **Basic Level**: Simple applications of EAFP/LBYL
- **Intermediate Level**: Performance comparisons and real-world scenarios
- **Advanced Level**: Complex systems and design decisions

**Recommended progression**:
1. Start with Basic Level exercises after completing the assignments
2. Move to Intermediate Level to explore performance implications
3. Tackle Advanced Level challenges to see patterns in larger systems

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Self-Assessment

### Check Your Understanding

After completing this module, you should be able to:

**Conceptual Understanding**:
- [ ] Explain the difference between EAFP and LBYL philosophies
- [ ] Identify when to use each approach based on context
- [ ] Understand the performance implications of each pattern

**Practical Skills**:
- [ ] Implement both EAFP and LBYL solutions for the same problem
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for error handling code
- [ ] Choose the appropriate pattern based on requirements

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] Write clean, readable code using both approaches
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully without silent failures
- [ ] Document your reasoning for choosing each approach

### Quick Self-Test

Try implementing these scenarios using both approaches:

1. **Dictionary Navigation**: Access `data['user']['preferences']['theme']`
2. **File Processing**: Read a JSON configuration file with fallback
3. **Type Conversion**: Convert user input to integer with validation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-using exceptions**: Don't use EAFP when LBYL is more appropriate
2. **Silent failures**: Always handle errors explicitly, don't ignore them
3. **Inconsistent patterns**: Choose one approach per function/module
4. **Performance assumptions**: Measure before optimizing
